# 💡 Customer Churn Prediction App (Streamlit + ANN)

This project is an interactive **Streamlit web app** that predicts whether a customer will **leave a bank (churn)** or **stay**, using a trained **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🧠 **Project Overview**

Customer churn prediction is a key task in customer retention strategies.  
This model uses customer demographics and banking details to predict the probability of churn.

The app allows users to enter customer information (like geography, gender, balance, credit score, etc.) and see a **real-time churn prediction**.
